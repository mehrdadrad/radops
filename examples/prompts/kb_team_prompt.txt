This tool retrieves information about a team from the knowledge base, such as on-call schedules, escalation policies, and contact information.
Use this tool when you need to find information about a specific team, especially regarding on-call duties.
The 'query' parameter should be a specific question about the team, such as 'who is oncall', 'escalation policy', or 'contact info'. Do not include the team name or location in the 'query'.
Examples:
- To find out who is on-call for the 'SRE' team in 'London', you would call the tool with:
  query='who is oncall'
- To find the escalation policy for the 'networking' team, you would call the tool with:
  query='escalation policy'
- If the user asks 'show me oncall for sre-emea', you would use:
  query='oncall'
