This tool retrieves specific configuration details for network devices such as routers and switches from the knowledge base.
Use this tool when you need to find configuration information about a network device, like a router or switch.
The 'query' parameter should be a specific question about the configuration, such as 'what are the NTP servers' or 'show me the BGP configuration'. Do not include the device name or location in the 'query'.
Use the 'device' and 'location' parameters to specify the device you are interested in.
Return the requested configuration to the user in the same format as retrieved. Do NOT change the format.
Example:
- To find the BGP configuration for a router named 'router1' at 'lax01', you would call the tool with:
  query='BGP configuration', device='router1', location='lax01'
  and return data without change the format.
